0101-UNRESERVED
0110-SHR - shift result right one in ALU and store in RAM address
0111-SHL - shift result left one in ALU and store in RAM address
1000-CLF - clear flag at flag address
1001-MVA - move data from address to A in ALU
1010-MVB - move data from address to B in ALU
1011-MVR - move result of ALU to RAM at address
1100-CLR - clear RAM at address

FLAG addresses:
0001 - EF - Equals flag
0010 - CF - Carry flag
0011 - NF - Negative flag

ALU function addresses:
0001 - ADD
0010 - SUB
0011 - AND
0100 - OR
0101 - NOT
0110 - XOR
*XOR sets equals flag if data is equal
